How does this project works? 
Well basically ive done scripting in bash terminal can work on zsh terminal aswell tho.
Anyways you need to have linux any distro doesnt matter but terminal either bash or zsh.
Paste those .sh files in home directory.
chmod +x ahmedscript.sh
chmod +x weather.sh
chmod +x weather.sh
basically chmod +x makes your file executable so do all those in your terminal
then ./ahmedscript.sh
Make sure all those uh files are together. Well i prefer put home in your main dir.
